# PrecisionBOM: Our Thesis

## The Future of Hardware Engineering is Agentic

We believe the next generation of software doesn't wait for prompts — it works autonomously, in parallel, like the best engineering teams on earth. PrecisionBOM exists to prove that AI agents can do in 4 minutes what takes hardware engineers 40+ hours: source a bill of materials with confidence, compliance, and cost optimization baked in.

## What We're Proving is Possible

### A Weekend Can Replace a Quarter

Four engineers. Thirty hours. Twenty thousand lines of code across four production deployments. This is not a prototype — this is a live platform processing real BOMs against real supplier APIs. Cline was our force multiplier, helping us maintain velocity and consistency across TypeScript, Python, and Solidity codebases simultaneously. AI Native Studio let us iterate on agent architectures faster than we could have sketched them on a whiteboard. The old model of software development — months of planning, sprints, standups — is being compressed into focused bursts of human-AI collaboration.

### Agents Should Be Specialists, Not Generalists

Asking a single model to understand component lifecycle status, supply chain risk, budget constraints, and market volatility is like asking one person to be your CTO, CFO, and procurement lead simultaneously. PrecisionBOM runs four specialized agents — Engineering, Sourcing, Finance, and Market Intelligence — that operate in parallel, each with deep context about their domain. CrewAI orchestrates the collaboration. GPT-5-nano handles inference at speeds that make real-time analysis actually real-time. We tried older models. They were too slow. When an engineer uploads a BOM, they want answers before their coffee gets cold.

### Real-Time Intelligence Changes Everything

Your BOM doesn't exist in a vacuum. Somewhere right now, a manufacturer is announcing an end-of-life notice. A factory is shutting down. A shortage is brewing. Most procurement teams find out weeks later — after they've committed to parts they can't get. Our Market Intelligence agent, powered by Apify, continuously scrapes supply chain news, manufacturer announcements, and shortage alerts. It feeds this intelligence directly into sourcing decisions. This is the difference between reactive procurement and proactive supply chain management.

### Trust Requires Traceability

For consumer electronics, "trust me" might be good enough. For medical devices, aerospace, and automotive — industries where a bad component can kill people — you need receipts. Immutable receipts. PrecisionBOM writes every sourcing decision to an ERC-7827 smart contract on Ethereum. When the FDA asks why you chose that capacitor from that supplier at that price, you point to the chain. The decision, the reasoning, the alternatives considered — all permanently recorded.

### Capture Interest at the Speed of the Internet

Rilo handles our lead acquisition — capturing signups from our landing page and enriching prospect data so we know who's interested and why. We didn't build custom forms or wire up email integrations. We plugged in Rilo and focused on the product.

## What This Means

The procurement specialist spending 40 hours per project manually cross-referencing datasheets, checking stock levels, and documenting decisions? That job just changed. Not eliminated — elevated. PrecisionBOM handles the grunt work so engineers can focus on what humans do best: make judgment calls, build supplier relationships, and design better products.

Every tool we used this weekend — Cline, AI Native Studio, CrewAI, OpenAI, Apify, Rilo — represents a new primitive. A building block that didn't exist two years ago. If a weekend team can build enterprise-grade procurement automation, what else is suddenly possible?

This is what building looks like now. Less typing. More orchestrating. And a whole lot more leverage.
